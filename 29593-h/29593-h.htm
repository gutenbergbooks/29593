<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you see that this book is dedicated to

however, and sends you this soldier story with
her very best love&mdash;the love she bears in her

those same precious little heads for a kindly remembrance

<h2>THE STORY OF THE SOCKS.</h2>

<h3>BY AUNT FANNY.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh</span> dear! what <i>shall</i> I do?" cried
George, fretfully, one rainy afternoon.
"Mamma, do tell me what to do."</p>

<p>"And I'm <i>so</i> tired!" echoed Helen,
who was lazily playing with a kitten
in her lap. "I don't see why it should
rain on a Friday afternoon, when we
have no lessons to learn. We can't go
out, and no one can come to see us.
It's too bad, there!"</p>

<p>"Helen, do <i>you</i> know better than
<i>God?</i>" asked her mother, speaking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
very gravely. "You forget that He
sends the rain."</p>

<p>"I suppose I was thoughtless, mamma,"
answered the child; "I did not
mean to be wicked, but, dear me, the
time passes <i>so</i> slowly, with nothing to
do."</p>

<p>"Have you and George read all
your books?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! two or three times over,"
they both answered; "and oh, mamma,"
continued Helen, "if the one who
wrote 'Two Little Heaps,' or the 'Rollo'
book writer, or the author of 'The
Little White Angel,' would only write
some more books, I, for one, would
not care how hard it rained. If I was
grown up and rich, I wouldn't mind
giving a dollar a letter for those stories."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor I," shouted George in an
animated tone, quite different from
the discontented whine he had favored
his mother with a few moments before;
"the best thing is to have them
read aloud to you; that makes you
understand all about it so much better.
I say, mamma, couldn't you write
a letter to one of those delightful people
and beg them to hurry up with
more stories, especially some about
bad children;&mdash;not exactly wicked,
you know, but full of mischief. <i>Then
I am sure that they are all true.</i> Only
wait till I'm a man! I'll just write
the history of some jolly fellows I
know who are always getting into
scrapes, but haven't a scrap of meanness
about them. That's the kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
book I like! I'll write dozens of them,
and give them to all the Sunday
school libraries."</p>

<p>His mother smiled at this speech,
and then said quietly, "I know a gentleman
who likes the story of 'The Little
White Angel,' as much as you do,
and he has written a letter to request
the author to write six books for
him."</p>

<p>"Six! hurrah!" shouted George,
"how glad I am!" and he skipped up
to Helen, caught her by the hands,
and the two danced round the room,
upsetting a chair, till Helen, catching
her foot in the skirt of her mother's
dress, they both tumbled down on the
carpet together.</p>

<p>"If you cut up such violent capers,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
said the kind mother, laughing,
"at the first part of my information,
it may be dangerous to tell you what
the author replied."</p>

<p>"Oh no, do tell us!" cried the
children. "We'll be as still as our
shadows;" and while they made violent
efforts to look grave and stand
quiet, their mother told them that the
author had consented, the six books
were to be written, and she would buy
them the very first day they were
published. "Perhaps," she continued,
"mind, only perhaps, I may get them
for you <i>before</i> they are ever printed."</p>

<p>"Why, how, mamma?" they both
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you make some
very good resolutions&mdash;let me see,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and she took a pencil out of her pocket,
and drawing a sheet of paper toward
her, began to write:</p>

<p>"1st. To endeavor to say your
prayers morning and evening without
a <i>wandering thought</i>.</p>

<p>"2d. To try to keep faithfully
'the Golden Rule.'</p>

<p>"3d. To obey your parents immediately,
without asking 'why?'</p>

<p>"4th. (A little rule, but very important.)
To keep your teeth, nails,
and hair scrupulously clean and neat.</p>

<p>"5th. To bear disappointments
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"There, I think that will do.
They are all hard rules except the
fourth. I do not keep them well myself,
my dear children. No one can,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
without constant watchfulness and
prayer for help from above; but you
can try, will you?"</p>

<p>"I will, mamma," said Helen, in a
low, earnest tone, her blue eyes filling
with tears.</p>

<p>"And you, George, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, I will try. I can't
be a very good boy, as you know. I
get so tired of being good sometimes,
that I feel like jumping over the house
to get the badness out of me, instead
of sitting down quietly and thinking
about my duty, as papa says I must.
When papa locked me up in his dressing
room last summer, and I kicked
the door as hard as ever I could,
which made him call out that I should
stay there two hours longer, I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
mad enough, I tell you! but I did not
cut my name with a knife on his rosewood
bureau <i>because</i> I was angry. It
was because I was almost crazy with
doing nothing but think what a bad
boy I was. That made me worse, you
see. The best way to punish me is to
see you crying about my conduct. I
can't stand that," and the boy put his
arms round his mother's neck, and
kissed her fondly.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said his mother,
returning the caress, "there is One
whom you grieve more than me. I
wish you would think oftener of that.
I know that different children require
different sorts of punishment, and as
neither your father nor I approve of
beating you like a dog, and you say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
that shutting you up with nothing to
do only makes you worse, I shall
advise him the next time you are
naughty, to send immediately for a
load of wood, and make you saw it all
up into small pieces, or take you where
some house is building and order you
to run up and down a long ladder all
day with a hod of bricks on your
shoulder, or hire you out to blow the
big bellows for a blacksmith. How do
you think you would like that?"</p>

<p>"I had a great deal rather run
after the fire engines, to put the fire
out. That's the kind of work I would
like. Every body screaming, and
pumping, and playing streams of water&mdash;twenty
firemen rushing up ladders,
pulling old women and cats out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the windows, and somebody inside
pitching out the looking glasses and
crockery to save them! I wish our
house was on fire this very minute,
so I could pull you and Helen out,
and save all the furniture. That
would be the greatest fun in the
world!"</p>

<p>"Please don't set fire to the
house," cried his mother, laughing,
"for the fun of saving our lives. I
prefer to keep it just as it is, and
walking quietly out at the door." As
she spoke, the sun suddenly burst
forth from the clouds, and his bright
rays darting into the room, the children
sprang joyfully up, and, with
their mother's consent, were soon out
of the house with jumping-rope and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
hoop, to join their little companions in
a neighboring park.</p>

<p>George and Helen were two charming,
ingenuous children. George was
full of frolic, mischief, and fun, with
generous impulses and excellent intentions,
which only required peculiar
and careful training and encouragement
to develop him into a steady,
high-principled man. Locking him
up with nothing to do, as he truly
said, did him more harm than good;
he required active punishment, and
his mother wisely intended to take
the hint for his future benefit. Her
little Helen, though just as full of play
and fun, was more easily managed.
A present of a book so won upon her
love and gratitude, that her mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
had only to hold out the prospect of a
new one, and a loving kiss (Helen
prized the kiss even more than the
book) as a reward for good behavior,
to make her quite a pattern of a dear,
amiable little girl.</p>

<p>The next morning the kind mother
called upon her friend Aunt Fanny,
bringing George and Helen with her, as
it was Saturday. First she told all the
conversation of the afternoon before,
which amused Aunt Fanny very much,
and then she <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'contined'">continued</ins>, "You told me
the other day that your daughter was
very busy writing six books for Mr. Leavitt
the publisher. I know you
love my children."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" cried Aunt Fanny.
"I love children from my heart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
straight out to the ends of my fingers;
and when a pen is in my hands, the
love runs into it, and then out again,
as fast as it can scratch all over ever
so many sheets of paper. My thumb
aches so sometimes with writing, that
I often wish I had half a dozen extra
ones, so I could take the tired one off
and screw another on, and even then
I am afraid I could never exhaust my
love for my darlings;" and she looked
at the children and held out her hand
with such an affectionate smile, that
Helen came timidly up and gave her
a little winning kiss immediately, while
George, blushing all over his face,
showed two great dimples in his
cheeks, but had not the courage to
leave his chair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>You may be sure that Aunt Fanny,
after Helen's kiss, was quite ready to
grant any favor the mother might ask
for her children. She was perfectly
willing to catch a comet for them to
play with, or jump down a volcano to
find out who lived in the bottom of it,
if anybody would only show her how.
Helen's mother knew this, but she
hesitated a little before she made this
strange request:</p>

<p>"My dear friend, my two children
have made me the promises I have
told you of, in regard to keeping my
little rules and resolutions, and now I
think it will be the most wonderful
and delightful reward possible, if they
were to be permitted to see and read
your daughter's stories in manuscript."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Manuscript! what does that mean,
mamma?"</p>

<p>"In her own handwriting, dear."</p>

<p>"Oh yes! yes! how very strange
and delightful! And then to see the
very same stories printed! that would
be so astonishing! We should like that
better than anything, Aunt Fanny!"</p>

<p>"Very well," continued their mamma;
"now I have come to beg you to
lend me the stories as fast as they are
written. I will take the greatest care
of them, and return them to your
daughter quickly and punctually. I
have a plan in my head which will
make my children very happy, if you
consent."</p>

<p>"To be sure I will," said Aunt Fanny,
"but what is your plan?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon commenced a great
whispering between the two ladies,
while the children looked pleased,
puzzled, and eagerly curious all at
once; but they were not to know.
Aunt Fanny and their mother, after a
great deal of nodding of heads together,
and laughing and whispering, got
this mysterious affair settled to their
satisfaction, and then took leave of
each other. Aunt Fanny kissed Helen,
and George, too, in spite of his blushes,
and told them to bottle up their patience
so that it would last for one
whole week, observing that she was
thankful that curiosity was not made
of gunpowder, and there was no danger
of their blowing up before the
great secret came out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very seldom that you hear of
such remarkably good children as
George and Helen were for the next
few days. They were really something
astonishing! George did not
slam the door more than once or twice
in a whole day; and one morning
when he was going to ride on the bannisters
as usual, he said "Oh, I forgot!"
and immediately walked down
stairs as slowly and gravely as a
grandfather.</p>

<p>As for Helen, she was, if possible,
still more wonderful, for she learned
"six times" in the multiplication table,
and said it straight on, and skipping,
and even backward, in a way
that surprised her teacher. Helen
could say "twice one" up to "five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
times twelve," very glibly, but "six
times" never would stay in her head,
she said; especially "six times nine."
She always said it was "seventy-two,"
or "sixty-three," or "eighty-one," at
a desperate venture, and was always
wrong. Now she knew, and meant to
remember; and would pack away the
fact that "six times nine are fifty-four,"
in a comfortable place in the
very middle of her head, to be ready
for any one that wanted to know it.</p>

<p>At last the next Friday came, and
just before the children retired for the
night, their mother said:</p>

<p>"Something came for you to-day.
Guess what it is?"</p>

<p>Up they both sprang, exclaiming,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
"Something for us? Oh, that is so
very delightful! What can it be?"</p>

<p>"My instructions are, to put it
either in George's sock or in Helen's
stocking, after you are fast asleep. It
is for both of you, and I leave you to
decide where it shall be put."</p>

<p>"In my sock!" shouted George.</p>

<p>"In my stocking!" cried Helen.</p>

<p>"Oh certainly, I forgot!" exclaimed
George, generously; "in Helen's
stocking."</p>

<p>"No, mamma," said Helen, "in
George's sock."</p>

<p>"Stocking!" cried George.</p>

<p>"Sock!" cried Helen.</p>

<p>They kept this up about a dozen
times, laughing and jumping about
the room like two crazy monkeys,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
their mamma and papa laughing too,
till all their faces were in a perfect
glow, which made them look like a
very handsome family&mdash;for, let me
tell you, that good humor and innocent
merriment are very becoming to
everybody, while ill-temper makes
one look like a fright.</p>

<p>But how was this difficult matter
of sock and stocking to be settled?
Why, by the children's papa, to be
sure! for he was a lawyer, and did
nothing all day long but settle difficulties,
or make them worse, I don't
know which.</p>

<p>He took two long slips of paper,
and wrote "Socks" on one and
"Stockings" on the other. These he
put in his hat, which George brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
out of the hall. Then he rang the
bell, and told the waiter who answered
it to request Mrs. Custard, the cook,
to come up to the parlor for a moment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Custard, who was very fat,
and, besides, had the rheumatism,
came into the room quite breathless,
looking very much surprised and a
little frightened. She had dropped
her thimble that day, when she was
sewing up the stuffing in the turkey,
and had not had time to look for it;
and she was panic struck lest her master
had found it roasted in the very
middle of the turkey, and was going
to ask her if she thought she was
cooking for an ostrich, which, as everybody
knows, prefers a dinner of iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
spikes, pebble stones, and oyster shells
to roast beef.</p>

<p>But nothing of the kind happened.
The children's papa only said, "Good
evening, Mrs. Custard, you gave us a
very nice dinner to-day. I want you
to put your hand in this hat and draw
out one piece of paper."</p>

<p>"Laws me, sir!" exclaimed the
cook, "I hopes you don't mean to play
no trick on me; will it bite?"</p>

<p>The children fairly screamed with
laughter at the idea of a piece of paper
biting; and the cook made them
laugh still harder, when she put her
hand in very cautiously, and twitched
it out three times, before she ventured
to feel for the paper.</p>

<p>At last one piece was caught, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
on it was written "SOCKS," which
made George first jump up and down
in an ecstacy of delight, and then run
to Helen and tell her he was really
sorry that it had not been the other.</p>

<p>This decided the momentous question,
and Mrs. Custard hobbled down
stairs, and the children hopped, skipped,
and jumped up stairs, both wondering
what would come of this magical
word "socks."</p>

<p>Helen had a pretty little room
opening out of her mother's, but
George's was in an upper story. When
they were both asleep, the mother
took out of her son's bureau a clean
white sock, sewed a tape loop on the
edge, put a small parcel inside, and
hung it on a neat brass nail, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was driven in a door directly opposite
his bed, where it would catch his eye
as soon as he awoke.</p>

<p>You may be sure both the children
were up bright and early the next
morning. Helen dressed herself quickly
and ran down stairs into the dining-room
to wait for her brother.</p>

<p>George opened his eyes upon the
sock the very first thing. He sprang
out of bed and made but two steps to
the door, raised his hand eagerly, and
then the generous little fellow stopped.</p>

<p>"No!" he cried aloud, "I will not
even squeeze the outside to guess what
it is, till I am with Helen."</p>

<span class="caption">GEORGE AND HELEN READING &quot;SOCKS&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>He did not stop to count his toes
or fingers, though he did manage to
clean his teeth, wash his face, neck,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and hands, and brush his hair in about
five minutes, then taking hold of the
precious sock by the loop at the top,
he carried it down stairs very much
as if he had hold of a mouse by the
tail. He was met by Helen at the
door with an "Oh, George, what is it?"</p>

<p>They both stared with all their
eyes, while George told Helen she
might take the wonderful thing out.
She gladly obeyed, and drew out a
compact roll of letter paper neatly tied
with sky-blue ribbon. Helen untied
the little bow, her fingers trembling
with eagerness, and unrolled the paper.
It seemed to be a great many
pages covered with writing, and they
were all fastened together at the top
with another bit of blue ribbon. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
fair and clear handwriting was delightful
to look at.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma! Oh papa! do come
and look!" cried George. "I do believe
this is a story before it is printed.
See! on the top of the page is written
'Colonel Freddy; or, the March and Encampment
of the Dashahed Zouaves.'"</p>

<p>"Yes; Aunt Fanny sent it to me
yesterday; and her daughter hopes her
little story about soldiers will please
you."</p>

<p>"Please us! I guess it will! I'd
rather hear about soldiers than anybody
else in the world, even giants!
because, you know, mamma, Uncle
Charley has gone to fight, and if the
Southerners had only put off the war
a few years longer, I would have gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to fight them too; so Hurrah for the
Dashahed Zouaves!"</p>

<p>"Three cheers for the Dashahed
Zouaves!" cried Helen, and they were
given with a will.</p>

<p>The children could hardly eat their
breakfast in their eagerness to hear
the story which was sent to them before
it was printed. This latter fact
gave it an extraordinary interest which
they could not explain. It seemed to
be such a remarkable honor to be singled
out in this way; particularly as
their mother told them, before she began
to read, that Aunt Fanny had requested
them to be sure to let her
know if they thought any part stupid
or too long, and her daughter would
improve and shorten it immediately.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>How extremely complimentary! to
be asked to sit and listen as critics
and judges, and they only children!
Really, it was almost too much to believe!</p>

<p>But it added tremendously to the
charm, and George and Helen took
their seats after breakfast, invested
with this new and important dignity,
with such an expression of solemn delight
on their faces, that their mother
had to run out of the room and have
a good laugh by herself in the hall,
after which she returned, and, with as
serious a face as she could call up with
those two little figures so stiff and stark
before her, smoothed out the manuscript,
and began as follows:</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>RAISING A REGIMENT.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> bright afternoon last summer,
about two weeks after the dreadful
battle of Bull Run, Freddy Jourdain
burst open the door of his mother's
room and rushed in, exclaiming:
"Jolly, mother! such fun! What <i>do</i>
you think the boys in our school are
going to do?"</p>

<p>"Why what?" asked his mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I should really like to know
why you come tearing up stairs yelling
like forty steam engines!" added his
sister Bella, who was rather a particular
young lady.</p>

<p>"Well," began Freddy, looking
very important, "I'll <i>try</i> to explain,
but I don't believe <i>you women</i> can
understand about <i>us boys!</i>"</p>

<p>"After that speech I think you
had better explain," said Bella, "if
you're not in want of a thimble pie on
your knuckles."</p>

<p>"Well, then," cried Freddy, with
sparkling eyes, "the boys at our
school are all <i>square</i> against that old
Jeff. Davis, and in recess yesterday, we
concluded that we ought to go and
help shoot the Southerners. So we've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
organized a regiment, and I'm chosen
Colonel; and I'm going to take my
regiment to camp on Monday, that is,
if you'll let me. Mayn't I, mother?
It's such fun, and Tom Pringle's given
me such a jolly popgun! Hurrah for
Jackson and the Stars and Stripes!"
So saying, Freddy cut a caper in the
air, that made about forty "chaney
alleys," "stony alleys," "glass agates,"
and "middles," pop out of his satchel,
which was slung over one shoulder,
and roll into all the corners of the
room.</p>

<p>"Where is your encampment to
be?" said his mother, as gravely as
she could.</p>

<p>"Oh, down on Mr. Schermerhorn's
place at Astoria. Peter Schermerhorn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
told us to-day that his father was willing
we should have it there, and has
invited us all to come and stay a whole
week. We're to live in <i>real tents!</i>"
(here Freddy couldn't help cutting another
caper,) "and cook our own dinners,
and&mdash;oh, mother, mayn't I go?
say!"</p>

<p>"I do not think of any objection
at present," replied Mrs. Jourdain,
"but you must wait until your father
comes home, and hear what he has to
say. It was very kind of Mr. Schermerhorn
to invite you all, but I am
afraid he will be driven distracted with
such a number of harem-scarem boys
running about his place."</p>

<p>At this moment Joseph, the black
waiter, knocked at the door, and announced,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
with an air of high-flown elegance,
that "Major Schermerhorn was
in the <i>drawing salon</i> (which he considered
the purest Parisian French for
front parlor), and desired to see Col.
Jourdain;" and our young friend was
off like a shot, Joseph following at a
dignified pace.</p>

<p>Joseph, like most other colored
servants in New York, was a person
of the highest fashion, according to
his own notions. No short words for
<i>him</i>, I can tell you. I remember well
the first time I called upon his mistress,
I inquired, "Does Mrs. Jourdain
live here?" and Joseph, drawing himself
up with an air of superior refinement,
replied, "Mrs. Jourdain <i>resides</i>
here, madam." At dinner parties, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
he waited upon table, he was the most
dignified person present, and held his
head up so high that he looked as if it
would shortly go through the chandelier.
He was always dressed in the
finest broadcloth and patent leather, his
black face and white necktie presenting
an admirable contrast, while he
used all the five cornered words in the
dictionary in replying to any question,
and always handed the dishes to the
ladies with a flourish of the most astonishing
character.</p>

<p>Now, if I tell you a secret, you
must promise not to let any one know
it. Freddy's parents live in the Fifth
avenue above Madison Square, in the
city of New York. His father is a rich
man, and Freddy, a bright, manly lad,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
between thirteen and fourteen at the
time I am writing about, and the only
son, is a good deal indulged. But
don't think he ever abuses the kindness
of his loving papa and mamma;
no&mdash;although he is full of noise, fun,
and innocent mischief, he is a good,
obedient little fellow&mdash;and that is why
they love to do all they can to make
him happy. But you must not tell
that I said where he lives.</p>

<p>When Mr. Jourdain came home
that evening, Freddy, of course, began
to tell him the first thing, about the
regiment and Mr. Schermerhorn's delightful
invitation. You may be sure
he gave a full-length description of
the pleasures of camp life, as retailed
by Peter to an enthusiastic audience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
at recess; and backed up his request
to go by such powerful pleas of sparkling,
eager eyes, flushed, happy face,
and irresistible, dimpling smile, that
the hardest-hearted papa in existence
would have said "yes." Mr. Jourdain,
being anything but hard-hearted,
readily consented, as he was intimately
acquainted with Mr. Schermerhorn
and family, and knew there was no
fear on a private place of their meeting
with danger, or getting into trouble.</p>

<p>Then his father went on to ask a
great many questions about the regiment,
how many boys belonged to it,
what their sizes were, and where they
lived; all of which Freddy delightedly
answered, and kept up a continuous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
chattering until a quarter past nine,
which, being his bed time, he was reluctantly
obliged to trot up stairs.</p>

<p>After he was fairly out of the room,
his father and mother had a long consultation,
which resulted next day in
Mr. Jourdain's paying a visit to
"Brooks Brothers," the tailors in
Broadway, and afterward going to a
certain store in Maiden Lane, which
had all manner of toy knapsacks and
guns in the window. What could he
have gone there for, I wonder? and
then betaken himself to the police station
in B&mdash;&mdash; street? Really, it seems
very mysterious, but wait a little, and
you'll see.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Freddy, with his satchel
hanging down his back to look as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
much like a knapsack as possible,
marched off to school bright and early;
whistling the "Star-spangled Banner"
as he went along, and looking
with the utmost pity upon strange
boys, who hadn't the honor of belonging
to his glorious regiment, the
"Dashahed Zouaves," as his father
had advised him to name it.</p>

<p>He reached Dr. Larned's academy
just as Peter, Harry, and half a dozen
others were going in. They greeted
him directly with a shout of "Well,
Fred, what does your father say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm to go!" cried Freddy, "I
say, fellows, what do you think of the
Dashahed Zouaves for a name?"</p>

<p>"That's splendid! capital!" was
the cry of the party. I am afraid I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
must add that Peter said "that's
<i>gay!</i>"</p>

<p>There was no time to talk now,
however, for it was full nine o'clock;
so the boys, hanging up their hats in
the hall, entered the school room, and
prayers over, the lessons began.</p>

<p>But who could be very attentive
to his <i>ante</i>-cedents, or <i>uncle</i>-cedents
either, when, in three days, the <i>se</i>-cedents
were to be utterly routed by the
Dashahed Zouaves? The boys were
so full of chuckle and bounce, that,
I'm afraid, poor Dr. Larned would
have become cracked and crazy, if he
hadn't reflected that the holidays and
Fourth of July, or, as Peter called it,
"the Fourth of Ju-New Year's" were
coming, and that probably the state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of things was owing to those important
facts.</p>

<p>The recitations on that memorable
Friday, however, were something wonderful,
sure enough. For instance, the
lesson in geography was about China.
The doctor asked a boy, "Where is
Shanghai situated?" and he replied,
"On Long Island, about two miles
from Astoria landing!&mdash;that is," and
there he stopped, looking as awkward
and silly as a Shanghai chicken.</p>

<p>"Won't do, sir," said the doctor, in
a grave tone, "you must study the
lesson over again, and go down one;"
and down he had to go, feeling rather
flat.</p>

<p>Then the doctor asked Freddy
what the principal manufactures were,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and he answered, "Tea, porcelain, silk,
and Zouave drill&mdash;no, no, the other
kind of drill! dear me, what do I
mean?"</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," returned Doctor
Larned, in a severe tone, but with
a little bit of a smile hiding in the
corner of his mouth. "You appear to
be thinking of anything but your lessons,
young gentlemen&mdash;but as it is
the last day of school, I excuse you.
We will have recess earlier than usual,
and see if we cannot do better afterward."</p>

<p>So saying, he opened the door
leading from the school room to his
private study, and went in; while the
boys, luncheon in hand, ran to the
playground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"The playground," as it was called,
was the large yard attached to the
house, which had been fitted up with a
few simple gymnastic contrivances, and
formed a capital place where the boys
might amuse themselves in fine weather.
Down they sat, and for a few moments
were so busy trying who could
take the biggest semicircular bite out
of a slice of bread and butter that nobody
spoke a word. At last Freddy
commenced, by calling out,</p>

<p>"I say, fellows!"</p>

<p>"Silence in the guard tent! the
Colonel's going to speak!" cried Peter,
making a new version of the old
school saying.</p>

<p>"Don't you know all the real Zouaves
have their hair cut as short as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
anything? and just look at mine!" and
Freddy tossed back his silky, golden
curls in high disgust.</p>

<p>"Fellows, <i>it must be done!</i> We
must have that hair off, short order!"
continued the Colonel, solemnly.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed George Chadwick,
who was the oldest of the party,
and would certainly have been
Colonel if Freddy had not been prime
favorite with everybody, "Don't you
see how we can manage that?"</p>

<p>"Why, how?" was the general
question.</p>

<p>"Just you wait a moment," replied
the inventor, and he put for the house
in double quick time, whence he presently
returned with an immense pair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of scissors, which he had borrowed of
the cook.</p>

<p>"Now, then, who'll be scissorized
first?"</p>

<p>"I! I! I!" cried a chorus of
voices.</p>

<p>"Can't do every one at once;
come, Freddy, you're the commander-in-chief,
suppose you set the example."</p>

<p>"Here goes, then!" exclaimed
Freddy; and down he sat on the
spring board.</p>

<p>Snip! went the long scissors, and
off came a beautiful curl. Snap! more
demolition on the other side, and in
five minutes such a worn-out old
scrubbing brush as his head looked
like, never was seen anywhere, even
on a Zouave; George, of course, running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
out his tongue so far at every
snip of the scissors, that it was a mercy
it didn't get cut off, too.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="600" height="419" alt="&quot;FIRE AWAY OLD CHAP!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;FIRE AWAY OLD CHAP!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Jolly! what a fright you look!"
shouted Peter. "I say Freddy, I expect
you'll scare General Beauregard
into the cholera the first time he sees
you. Now, then, it's my turn; fire
away old chap!"</p>

<p>My conscience! what hair cutting
that was! Some parts were scratched
nearly bald, while in others, little
bunches of hair were left standing up
like stubble in an autumn cornfield.
Their heads looked as if they had been
gnawed by the mice or dug up in spots
by the roots; and I am sure their own
mammas would scarcely have known
them again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, number three's turn now!"
exclaimed George, flourishing his scissors.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know about that,"
put in Tom Pringle, who was the most
thoughtful of the party, "I guess I'd
rather see what my mother thinks before
I have <i>my</i> hair cut off."</p>

<p>This speech caused the rest of the
regiment to think of something which
hadn't struck them before, namely
what <i>their</i> mothers would say on the
subject of Zouave hair dressing, and
as George began to be a little frightened
by this time, at the fearful and
astonishing results of his patent plan,
it was decided to defer the rest of the
operation until another time.</p>

<p>But the amazement of Dr. Larned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
when he beheld his pupils in such a
condition, was beyond everything.</p>

<p>"Why, Peter! Freddy! what have
you been doing?" he exclaimed, raising
his hands, and pushing his spectacles
to the top of his forehead, to look
at them better.</p>

<p>"Oh, only getting our hair cut in
the Zouave pattern," said Peter, as
cool as a cucumber. "Don't you
know, Doctor, that we've organized a
regiment?"</p>

<p>"Organized a regiment!" repeated
the doctor, his spectacles almost
falling off with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, the Dashahed Zouaves;
haven't you heard of them?"</p>

<p>"Is there any end to the mischief
of boys?" exclaimed the doctor; "If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
such things had happened in my young
days, our old master, Dr. Birchemwell,
would have verified his name even oftener
than he did. I do not know
what your mothers will say when they
see such a couple of scarecrows; but
come, we have wasted quite time
enough; lessons! lessons!"</p>

<p>And to the credit of the boys, be
it said, they really did set to work
like good fellows, recited the unlucky
geography lesson without a single mistake,
ciphered like perfect calculating
machines, and had the pleasure of
hearing Dr. Larned say, as they shook
hands for good-bye, "Really, young
gentlemen, you have done very well&mdash;very
well, indeed; so now good-bye,
and pleasant holidays!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>"MARCHING ALONG."</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Monday</span> morning at last! and a
bright, beautiful day. The sky was as
blue as possible; the sun shone so
brightly that it seemed as though it
must have been polished up for the occasion,
and Colonel Freddy, as soon as
he awoke, could not help giving a little
shout of joy.</p>

<p>But what was that right opposite
his bed? A large wooden box, with
"Colonel Jourdain, Dashahed Zouaves,
First Regiment L. I. Volunteers,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
painted on the lid in great black letters.</p>

<p>Up jumped the new Colonel quicker
than any grasshopper, rushed to the
mysterious box, and raised the lid.
Lying on top was a letter at least six
inches square, directed like the box,
and closed with a great red seal. Underneath
<i>that</i> was&mdash;what do you think?
A splendid uniform for a Colonel of
Zouaves! sword, cap, and epaulettes,
complete!</p>

<p>Freddy's eyes and mouth opened
to their widest compass, as he stared
at the box, too much surprised to
move. Presently his father came in,
looking highly amused.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Colonel," he began.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, father!" interrupted Freddy,
finding his tongue at last, "do look
here! Did you ever see anything so
splendid in your life? Where <i>did</i> they
come from?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the letter will tell you,"
was all his father would say.</p>

<p>Freddy snatched up the big letter,
broke the seal, and with sparkling
eyes read the following.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>
<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>July &mdash;th, 1861</i>.
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">My dear Son</span>:</div>

<p>In consideration of your heroic
determination to enter the army in
the service of your country, and seeing
how nobly you have prepared to engage
in the contest by making your
hair look as if it had been driven in or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
pulled out, I have thought best to
present you with this uniform to whip
the Southerners in; a suit of which I
have also sent to every <i>man</i> in your
regiment. As I entertain scarcely a
doubt that Old Abe will shortly summon
you to start down South to Dixie,
I hope that you will have a brave
regiment, a pleasant encampment, and
a first-rate time. And that, in later
years, should it be necessary, you will
<i>truly</i> distinguish yourself, through
God's assistance, under the banner of
our country, and stand up in the field
in the cause of Truth and Justice, is
the sincere wish of</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Your affectionate Father,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">L. Jourdain</span>.<br />
</div>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Freddy was delighted at this letter,
with its mingled playfulness and
sincere patriotism. With all his fun,
he was uncommonly intelligent, and
understood and appreciated many
things which far older boys might
have failed to comprehend; and now
his splendid blue eyes were raised to
his father's face, flashing with real enthusiasm;
he felt and looked at that
moment, like his noble French ancestors,
a born soldier.</p>

<p>But the serious mood was soon
displaced by a fresh access of glee.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, papa!" he cried,
"how very kind of you! How surprised
the boys will be! Hurrah!
what a jolly time we shall have! and
do you think the President will really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
send for us? He will be a perfect jay-bird
of a President if he does!"</p>

<p>"No doubt he will be highly desirous
to secure the services of the
gallant Dashahed Zouaves," replied
his father, laughing; "but make haste
now, Fred, it's nearly breakfast time."
So saying, he left the room.</p>

<p>Of course, the new clothes had to
go on directly; and first my young
soldier donned a pair of remarkably
baggy red trowsers, which looked as
if they had a connection with the
Manhattan Gas Company like a new
sort of balloon, they were so puffy;
and a pair of leather gaiters reaching
from the calf of the leg to the ancle.
Then came a most splendid bluejacket,
covered in every direction with gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
lace, a killing little ruffled shirt, and a
flourishing blue sash. Perched on top
of his head, where his hair had been
the day before, was a red fez with a
long blue tassel, and, to crown all, or,
I might say, <i>cutting-out</i> everything
else, was a splendid sword, as bright
as silver, with a terribly sharp-looking
edge, and an elegant gold handle.</p>

<p>When he was all dressed, he ran
down stairs and found, on entering the
dining room, that he was the only one
there. A large mirror was over the
mantel, which reflected the handsome
room, with its deep bay window, filled
with flowers, its sideboard, loaded
with massive plate, and the breakfast
table, covered with its snowy cloth,
and nice beefsteak, muffins, and coffee,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
looking so tempting to hungry
folks.</p>

<p>Freddy's eye fell on the mirror,
and a new idea came into his head.
"Hurrah! here's a capital chance to
see how I look from head to foot," he
thought; so, without remembering the
long pier glasses in the parlor, he
dragged his father's arm chair in
front of the fireplace, and, jumping
on the seat, stood turning and twisting
about, staring at himself all the time,
and quite put out at not being able to
see the whole of his back at once. Finally
he concluded his performance by
striking a tremendous attitude, with
his legs as far apart as the chair would
permit, his sword in the air, and such
a ferocious scowl on his face, that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
was a mercy his brows didn't get tied
up in a double bow knot then and
there.</p>

<p>All at once there was a little laugh
in the direction of the door. Freddy
wheeled round, and there were papa,
mamma, and Bella looking on, and
trying hard to keep in the laughter!</p>

<p>Down scrambled Colonel Freddy
from his perch, blushing up to the
very roots of his hair. There wasn't
much more than the roots left, to be
sure; but his father laid his hand on
the epauletted shoulder with a good-natured,
"Never mind, old fellow, you
look fine enough to justify a little personal
reflection."</p>

<p>Hardly had Freddy taken his place
at the table, and his father asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a blessing, than there came such a tremendous
ring at the bell, that they
thought the President must have come
to town to see the regiment off on its
travels; but, instead of Old Abe, Major
Peter Schermerhorn (who passed the
week with an aunt in town, and only
went down to Astoria on Saturdays)
popped into the room. He was
dressed, like Freddy, in a bran new
Zouave suit, and the very first thing
he said was, "Oh, Fred! only see
what I found in my room this morning;"
and Peter stood on one leg, and
twirled round to show off his new
clothes.</p>

<p>"So did I in mine!" said Freddy.</p>

<p>"Where could they have come
from?" continued Peter. "I asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Aunt Edith, and all she would tell me
was that the box was sent last night,
from a friend. Have you any idea,
Fred?"</p>

<p>Freddy burst out laughing. "They
came from a good fairy," he said,
"and there he is!" and he pointed to
his father, who pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Mr. Jourdain!"
shouted Peter, tossing his cap in the air.</p>

<p>"Will you have some breakfast,
Peter?" asked Mrs. Jourdain.</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am, I had my
breakfast before I started, all alone by
myself&mdash;but," looking at the nice beefsteak,
"I think I <i>could</i> eat a little more."</p>

<p>"How many apples, by the way
Peter?" asked Bella, mischievously.</p>

<p>"Only two," he answered, quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
seriously, "and a piece of taffy, and
two cents' worth of peanuts! that's
all, I think; no, a cent's worth of ice
cream!"</p>

<p>"Of ice cream!" exclaimed Bella,
"where can you get ice cream for a
cent?"</p>

<p>"Why, on the street corners&mdash;real
good ice cream, too&mdash;don't you know
that?" and Peter put on an air of superior
wisdom, as though he was a
knowing young gentleman, who understood
better than anybody where
nice things were to be had.</p>

<p>"But come, Peter," said Mr. Jourdain,
"I should like to hear something
more about your encampment. How
long is your father willing you should
have it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father says, sir," replied Peter,
"that we can stay until he leaves for
Niagara, which will be next week, I
guess. We're to have our camp on the
lawn, most a quarter of a mile from
the house, and some of our men are
fixing the tents this morning. There
are to be eight of 'em&mdash;isn't that gay,
Fred? and we've got the smoke house
by way of a guard tent beside; but
there&mdash;I forgot all this time that I have
a letter from papa for you, sir&mdash;here it
is."</p>

<p>Mr. Jourdain opened the letter,
and read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">My dear Jourdain</span>:<br />

<p>I send you three words, through
my harum-scarum Peter, merely to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
beg that Mrs. Jourdain and yourself
will feel no uneasiness concerning the
military expedition which has been
the principal subject of discussion in
my household, and I presume in yours
also, since Thursday last. The invincible
Zouaves will be stationed too
near the house to make any danger
possible, and as my family are going
to Niagara on Tuesday, and I shall be
left a "lone lorn creetur," it will be as
much an amusement as anything to
make their safety and happiness my
special care.</p>

<p>Hoping that you will permit Fred
to remain in my charge a few days, I
am, with regards to Mrs. Jourdain,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Very sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">H. Schermerhorn.</span>"<br />
</div>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling went the front
door bell, as if the bull in Cock Robin
had hold of the handle. Tramp, tramp,
shuffle, shuffle, in the hall, and then
Joseph tapped at the door, and showed
in a whole troop of merry, noisy boys,
all costumed &agrave; la Zouave, and with
their hair shaved so close that they
had to frown very hard to keep their
caps on.</p>

<p>The famous Dashahed Zouaves
were all mustered, sure enough; and
turned out to consist of sixteen high
privates, four captains, and a standard-bearer,
master Tom Pringle, with a
perfectly magnificent Star-spangled
Banner in his hand, surmounted by an
astonishing spread eagle. Then came
Major Peter Schermerhorn, who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the prime spirit of mischief of the
party, and last, though not least, the
great Colonel Freddy; who was dancing
about in a high state of glee; while
the rest of the <i>men</i>, seeing that the
<i>Colonel</i> didn't regard dignity in the
least, had an impromptu Zouave drill
(which consists principally in turning
somersaults) all round the dining
room, the grown people looking on,
in agonies of suppressed laughter.</p>

<p>While this novel entertainment was
in full swing, the bell tingled again,
and Joseph entered once more, to announce,
"Master Frederic, the escort
and the band have <i>arriven</i>, and desire
me to say that they are awaiting your
pleasure."</p>

<p>The escort and the band! Was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
there any end to wonders this morning?
At those magical words, the
regiment couldn't resist giving three
cheers that nearly took the top of the
house off; followed by three for Mr. Jourdain,
when Peter made a mock-heroic
speech about the uniforms; and
finished off with a dozen more for
anybody and everybody. At last Mr. Jourdain
glanced at his watch and
said, "Come, Colonel, I'm afraid you'll
miss the boat if you don't make haste.
Remember, you have a long march
before you, and it is almost ten o'clock
now."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's a fact!" exclaimed the
commander. "Ahem! fall in, old
chaps, that is, squad&mdash;battalion&mdash;what's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
his name; pshaw! and let's be
off."</p>

<p>This mandate to "fall in" certainly
appeared to be translated "poke
in" by the greater part of the corps,
for it was directly followed by such a
treading upon everybody's toes, and a
ramming of elbows into other people's
stomachs and chests, and such imminent
danger incurred of every eye in
the company being put out with bayonets
held upside down, straight out,
wiggle-waggle, and "various," as rendered
it highly likely that matters
would be terminated by a fall <i>out;</i>
but at last they were fairly in line, and
marched down the steps into the
street; feeling a little shame-faced, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
excessively proud of their new and
conspicuous position.</p>

<p>All the neighbors were leaning out
of windows, nearly petrified with astonishment
at what was going on;
while at least fifty little ragged boys
stood staring at the door, their eyes
almost popping out of their heads, as
the glorious Dashahed Zouaves made
their appearance; trying desperately
to tuck in the broad grins that <i>would</i>
show at the corners of their mouths,
and disturb the proper gravity of a
soldier.</p>

<p>But their good behavior was nearly
put to flight altogether when they
beheld, waiting to escort them, three
of the tallest policemen in the city (to
engage whom Mr. Jourdain had made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
that third call, you remember, in
B&mdash;&mdash; street), and Dodworth's splendid
brass band, marshalled in full
force.</p>

<p>Oh! how their eyes did sparkle!
They could hardly get into marching
order, or wait until Freddy, who had
lingered behind to say good-by, came
out and took his place at the head of
the regiment. Then, with one more
tremendous cheer, rang out the command,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March!</span></p>

<p>Out burst the band with the glorious
"Star-spangled Banner;" brightly
streamed the folds of the flag itself in
the wind; proudly Colonel Freddy
waved his sword in the air; and so,
with steps that kept time to the music,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and hearts that thrilled with a
mixture of fun and patriotism, the gallant
Dashahed Zouaves marched off
for Camp McClellan.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>CAMP LIFE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Toot-tooo!</span> went the whistle of
the steamboat "Mattano." "All
aboard!" yelled the captain, and all
aboard it was for the Dashahed Zouaves,
and ever so many people beside,
who, you may be sure, were all
eyes when they found out that such a
<i>killing</i> regiment was going down with
them.</p>

<p>"Good-by, my boy," called Mr.
Jourdain (who had followed the
march in a stage) from the wharf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-by, father; I say, old
Beauregard will have to keep his eyes
open now the Dashahed Zouaves are
in the field!" and Freddy waved his
cap in one hand and his sword in the
other to his father, as long as he could
see him.</p>

<p>In a few moments the boat was
fairly out from the wharf, and the
whole regiment comfortably seated on
the promenade deck; very proud of
their new responsibilities as members
of the army and society generally, and
surrounded by a crowd of admirers.</p>

<p>"Jolly, ain't I hungry!" exclaimed
Freddy, as he joined them; "I went off
with hardly any breakfast, I declare!
wasn't that noble?"</p>

<p>"Noble? I don't see it!" said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Charley Spicer. "Nobody asked you
to go without your breakfast!"</p>

<p>"Why, wasn't I in a hurry to serve
my country? When I was so full of
glory, I couldn't stop to get full of
beefsteak and coffee beside!"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" cried Harry Livingston,
"I have some sandwiches in
my knapsack, and you shall have
some, Fred."</p>

<p>"Have you? there's six big apples
in mine," said Charley.</p>

<p>"Here's a quart of peanuts and
half a pound of taffy for my share,"
added Jimmy Boorman.</p>

<p>"And I've a pair of broiled spring
chickens! high diddle-diddle!" shouted
George.</p>

<p>"Good boy!" exclaimed Tom Pringle;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
"here, take my molasses and water
bottle&mdash;canteen, I mean, and pass
round the tin plate for the Colonel!"</p>

<p>Amid high glee, every one bestowed
a part of his provisions on Freddy
until a sufficiently motley meal was
collected; half of which he immediately
offered again to his companions, who,
of course, were quite ready to feel
hungry too, and they all munched together,
like a company of gypsies.</p>

<p>"I say, Capting," said a tall Yankee
in a fur hat, to Peter, "what
may yew calculate dewing on Long
Island?"</p>

<p>"Why, we're going into camp, to
be sure."</p>

<p>"Lors-a-massy! them air boys
all alone by theirselves!" exclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
an old countrywoman, carrying a large
market basket, and wearing a great
pair of brass-rimmed spectacles. "It
beats all natur!"</p>

<p>"Yew ha'n't got no one to look
arter you?" continued the tall Yankee.</p>

<p>"Certainly; here's our commanding
officer, Col. Jourdain."</p>

<p>"Let me present Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," added
Freddy, full of laugh, and highly enjoying
the fun.</p>

<p>"Captin George Washington Kosciusko
Peter Bonaparte Solomon Hopkins!"
said the countryman, with an
awkward bow; while the boys hardly
dared to look at each other, they
were so afraid of bursting out laughing
at his ridiculous name. Its fortunate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
possessor, nothing abashed, went on,
"But dew tell, wha&mdash;at on airth <i>dew</i>
you call yourselves?"</p>

<p>"These, sir," replied Freddy, as
grave as a judge, though his eyes
sparkled with fun, "are the famous
Dashahed Zouaves, First Regiment
Long Island Volunteers; I am the
Colonel, this is Major Schermerhorn,
Captains Spicer, Chadwick, Livingston,
and Boorman, Sergeant Pringle,
and Adjutant Costar."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>light infantry</i> regiment, I
calculate."</p>

<p>"No, sir, <i>heavy veterans!</i>" put in
Will Costar.</p>

<p>"Wal I never!" exclaimed Captin
George Washington Kosciusko Peter
Bonaparte Solomon Hopkins (here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the boat touched the pier of the
Flushing Railroad); "Naow mind, Kurnel
Jordan, if ever your regiment
comes to Hempstead, yeou put for
Captin Hopkins' farm, and if yeou
don't get the biggest lot of red apples
yeou ever <i>did</i> see, I'll be made into
apple pie myself!" and off marched the
Yankee, while the boys, as soon as he
was fairly out of sight, indulged rather
ungratefully in an explosion of laughter.</p>

<p>Presently the boat stopped at Ravenswood,
and here the old woman
got off; but before she went, she took
an immense shiny hunk of gingerbread
out of the great market basket, and
bestowed it on Freddy, saying, "Here,
take this, sonny; you air a dear little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
fellow, so like my Sammy, too"&mdash;and
the poor old woman's voice broke,
and tears began to gather under the
brass-bound spectacles, as she turned
to leave the boat.</p>

<p>Freddy put down his cake, and ran
after her, saying, "Thank you, ma'am,
thank you very much; I am sorry you
are distressed."</p>

<p>The old woman stopped, and saying
softly, "Bless you, my son!" she
kissed the bright, rosy cheek, and
went away quite comforted.</p>

<p>Freddy wasn't ashamed either, not
a bit, when they teased him afterward,
but said, "I don't care, she's a
real nice old thing; now, there!"</p>

<p>Soon the boat ran up to the wharf
at Astoria. Delighted to arrive at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
their journey's end, the boys scampered
off as soon as the plank touched
the shore, and "formed" on the road
in fine style.</p>

<p>"Goodness, Peter!" exclaimed
Freddy, "I hope it's not very far to
your father's place; I'm afraid I shall
be melted altogether if it is."</p>

<p>"Well, it <i>is</i> a good way," began
Peter, with rather a rueful face.</p>

<p>"So far that I intend to take you
there in comfort," said a pleasant voice
close behind them.</p>

<p>"Oh, father," cried Peter (for it
was Mr. Schermerhorn), "how kind
of you! Only look, boys!" and he
pointed to two double rockaways
which were waiting on the pier.</p>

<p>In they all swarmed, managing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
find places for everybody (and really,
it is surprising how a rockaway can
<i>stretch</i> on occasion), and after a rapid
drive along a level sandy road, the
ha-ha fences of Mr. Schermerhorn's
splendid country seat, "Locust Grove,"
came in view. Soon the carriages entered
the beautiful rustic gate, its pillars
surmounted by vases, filled with
trailing plants; and in a moment more
were dashing over the gravelled drive
toward the western side of the place.</p>

<p>At one point, the road led directly
over a deep ravine, spanned by a
bridge of rough logs. Then they
whirled past a tranquil lake, dotted
with pond lilies, and shaded by drooping
willows, through which might be
caught a glimpse of the tall white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
chimneys of the house. At last, with
a sudden bend, the drive came out on
a wide velvet lawn, relieved by a
fringe of the beautiful locusts, covered,
at this season of the year, with
the fragrant pinkish flowers. At some
distance a quaint Chinese summer
house served as an observatory; beds
of brilliant scarlet verbena and many-colored
petunias dotted the grass here
and there, and right before them, most
beautiful of all in their eyes, was the
encampment itself, eight snowy white
tents, four in a row, while in the midst
rose a tall flagstaff, with the dear old
Red, White, and Blue floating from
the summit.</p>

<p>"Hurrah, boys, there's the tents!"
shouted Peter, at the top of his voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
"Come, let's see who'll get there first;"
and, before the carriage could stop,
Peter had hopped out, tumbled head
over heels on the soft grass, jumped
up, and scampered on in advance, followed
a moment after by the rest.</p>

<p>These wonderful tents were furnished
just like real soldiers' dwellings;
with a good warm blanket for each
of the three occupants, a bright tin
basin and tooth mug, a cedar bucket
to draw water, a square looking glass,
like a sticking plaster, and a couple
of wooden lockers (which, between
ourselves, were made of claret boxes)
in each one; beside camp stools in
abundance for everybody.</p>

<p>"Here's the officers' quarters!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
cried George, as he flung open the
door of the smoke house.</p>

<p>"No, that's the guard house,
Chadwick," said Harry, "where we
put the refracti-rac-tic-tactories."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it? I go in for that!"
shouted Will Costar, "whatever reractitactories
may be."</p>

<p>"You're on the wrong tack now,
old chap," added Tom Pringle. "But
only see what I've discovered! such a
high old battery, boys! six brass cannon
nearly as big as boot-jacks. Hurrah
for the Dashahed Zouaves!" and
away scampered the boys to look at
the guns, while Colonel Freddy, quite
forgetting his dignity, fell to and executed
a volunteer Jim Crow polka,
and Peter sang the following ridiculous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
song, making up words as he
went along:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Ain't I glad I'm out in the wilderness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Out in the wilderness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Out in the wilderness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ain't I glad I'm out in the wilderness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Down in Astori-<i>or?</i></span><br />
<br />
"Good-by, boys, I'm off for Dixie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Off for Dixie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Off for Dixie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Good-by, boys, I'm off for Dixie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And sha'n't come back no more!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Schermerhorn had
been superintending certain arrangements
for the provisioning of the
camp, and presently a bugle call,
sounded by one of the stable men,
summoned the regiment to prepare for
dinner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter took a bucket and went to
draw some water; George and Harry
made a fire in the smoke house,
which, after all the guesses, turned
out to be intended for the regimental
kitchen; Jimmy and Tom were initiated
into the mysteries of frying ham
and potatoes by the cook, and the
rest set the table (for the soldiers considered
it a point of honor that they
should wait on themselves).</p>

<p>Amid high glee the table, consisting
of a broad smooth plank placed
upon horses, was laid with the tin cup
and plates, the pewter forks and
spoons, and horn-handled knives,
which the boys carried in their knapsacks
just like real soldiers, after
which the table was further embellished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
by the remains of the rations they had
brought with them, disposed around
wherever they thought the dishes
would have the best effect.</p>

<p>The grand feast of fried ham was
ready at last, and the new cooks
presented themselves and it at table,
very hungry and happy. Mrs. Mincemeat,
the fat cook, had made the boys
each put on one of her blue check
aprons, tied under their chins, to save
their uniforms; and when they appeared
in this new array, their faces
as red and shining as a stick of sealing
wax, there was a general shout of
laughter.</p>

<p>"Well, my precious babies," cried one.</p>

<p>"Don't soil your new bibs, my tiddy-ikle
duckies!" called another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, don't tease them," said
Freddy, the general peacemaker;
"Come, fellows, let's have dinner;
ham's good, I tell you!" and down
they sat at table, in high, good humor.</p>

<p>Of course the cooking business was
rather to amuse the boys than in earnest,
for the fried ham formed only a
small part of the abundant dinner set
before the gallant Zouaves. There
was lamb, and green peas, new potatoes,
fresh tomatoes, custard pudding,
and raspberries, all of which was pronounced
"fine," although Jimmy declared
there never was any dish at
Delmonico's to equal or surpass his
fried ham, and the others fully concurred
in this opinion.</p>

<p>As soon as the dinner was fairly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
under way, Mr. Schermerhorn rose
from his place at the table, where he
had been carving, and said, with a
pleased smile on his face, "Now, my
brave soldiers, I must take my leave.
Have the goodness not to do double-quick
over the flower beds, leave a
dish or so of cherries in the orchard,
and, whatever you do, don't tumble
into the lake, and I shall be satisfied."</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Mr. Schermerhorn!"
shouted Colonel Freddy. In
an instant every fellow was on his
feet, every cap was in the air, and a
tremendous "Hurrah! hurrah! ti-ga-a-ah!"
made the echoes around
Camp McClellan wake up in a hurry,
and poke their heads out of the hills
to see where the cannonading was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, being boys, the regiment
cleared the dishes in astonishing style,
and polished their plates so thoroughly
that you would hardly have
thought they wanted the grand washing
they had when dinner was over.</p>

<p>After stowing all the things away
neatly in the smokehouse, and arranging
their surplus luggage (which
had been sent down the previous Saturday),
in the lockers, they all had a
grand game at fox and geese, which
lasted until Freddy, perfectly worn
out with laughing and scampering
about, exclaimed, "Come, fellows, do
let's sit down and be quiet; I'm as
tired as if I had walked from here to
China."</p>

<p>"Yes, let's be <i>solemn</i> a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
while," said Peter. "In these <i>momentous</i>
times, we <i>army men</i> ought to be
thinking how to fix off the old secessionists
and that sort of thing. I
move we all sit down in a circle, and
the first who laughs shall tell a story."</p>

<p>The boys thought this was a grand
idea. So they found a nice place, just
beneath the sheltering boughs of the
locusts, and, putting the camp stools
in a ring, they sat down, to see how
solemn they could be. But it was no
use; though they pinched up their
mouths, and frowned, and did their
best to look like a company of highly
respectable owls, in two minutes they
all burst out laughing, so nearly together
that nobody could tell who had
begun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the broad faces had
come back to their proper length,
there was a general cry for a story;
and as Peter had instituted the new
regulation, he undertook to carry it
out; so, drawing a long breath to
start with, he commenced:</p>

<p>"Once upon a time, there lived a
family of bears in a thick wood.
Grumpy-growly, the father, was a jolly,
cross old fellow&mdash;oh! I guess he
was! and the little ones didn't dare so
much as to snap at a fly without permission,
when he was around.</p>

<p>"One day Grumpy-growly went out
to take a walk, bidding the young ones
to be very good while he was away;
for he was a widower, poor fellow! and
had to see after his family himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"As soon as he was fairly gone,
Longclawse, the eldest, said, 'Seems
to me, brothers, we have stood this
long enough. All the other cubs in
the wood can run about as they
please, and why should we be kept in
this poky old cave? Suppose we try
to get away the big log before the
door?' for this was what Grumpy-growly
put up to keep them at home.</p>

<p>"'Good! I go in for that!' cried
Bushyball, Titehugge, and Stubtail,
the other cubs.</p>

<p>"So first they tried to poke their
noses under the log, but the plaguy
old thing wouldn't stir. Then they
turned their backs against it, and all
kicked together with their hind legs,
and presently away it went, to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
great delight of the four bears, who
didn't trouble themselves to put it
back again, but just packed up their
carpet bags, and cut stick, I tell you."</p>

<p>Here Peter opened his eyes and
mouth very wide, and ran out his
tongue for a moment to get an airing,
a proceeding which he frequently repeated
during the story. Then he
went on:</p>

<p>"They had a jolly time climbing
trees, rolling on the soft grass, and
playing with the other bears they met;
but at last Titehugge and Stubtail, the
youngest, declared they were too tired
to go another step, and must take a
little nap. Longclawse and Bushyball
thought they would go off to see the
election, which they had been told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
was to take place that very day, and
the others, promising not to stir from
the spot without them, curled themselves
up into tight round balls, and
went to sleep.</p>

<p>"While they were dreaming away,
a fox came along. He was a cunning
old codger, and hated Grumpy-growly
like mustard, because the old fellow
had once treated him, in a fit of rage,
to a hug that nearly put an end to
him. When he saw the sons of his
enemy asleep, he made up his mind to
fool them in revenge; and after he had
rummaged both their carpet bags, to
see if there was anything worth taking,
he went up to Titehugge and
pulled his ear a little to waken him.
Titehugge, who was as cross as two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
sticks, and always fighting his brothers,
opened his eyes, and for a moment
looked so very like giving the
fox a gentle squeeze, that foxy was
rather startled. However, he took
courage, and laying his paw on his
heart, he made the bear such an elegant
bow that he nearly cracked his
spine. 'Ah, my d-e-a-r Titehugge! so
glad to see you. You know I have
always been a great friend of your
dear papa's, and now, I should be
overjoyed to do you a little favor. Do
you happen to know that there is a
tree near here, which is hollow from
root to branches, and filled with wild
bees' combs and honey?'</p>

<p>"'No! cried Titehugge, 'is there?
Show it to me directly, master fox,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and don't stand there gaping at me!'
You see, bears were never celebrated
for being polite, and Titehugge had no
more manners than any of 'em.</p>

<p>"'Come along, then,' said the fox,
'but take care to make no noise, or
you will waken your brother, and then
he'll be wanting to have half the
honey.'</p>

<p>"Titehugge was a selfish little pig&mdash;bear,
I mean&mdash;and though he felt
rather shy of going off alone for the
first time in his life, he was too greedy
after the honey to let that trouble him
much. However, he said, 'You had
better be careful not to play any
tricks, master fox, for if you do, I'll
give you a hug that will settle <i>you</i>&mdash;if
you are such a dear friend of mine.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"'My d-e-a-r friend!' exclaimed
the fox, 'd-o-n't say so! How can you
suppose I would do such a shabby
thing? Come, we shall soon be at the
tree.'</p>

<p>"Titehugge waited for nothing
more, but started off with master fox,
who kept on flattering him all the
way until Titehugge thought him the
first-<i>ratest</i> fellow in the whole world.
Presently they came to the hollow
tree, and Titehugge, without waiting
to ask any questions, shinned up like
a streak of lightning, and began smelling
down the hole. 'But, it looks very
dark down here,' cried he at last 'and
I don't see any honey'.</p>

<p>"'Oh, you must poke your nose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
further in,' said the fox, 'and you'll
soon come to it.'</p>

<p>"Titehugge accordingly rammed
and jammed his head with great difficulty
into the hole, which proved such
an uncommonly tight fit, that, not finding
any honey, he began trying to pull
it back double quick; but lo and behold!
pull and tug, scratch and swear as
he might, he was caught in a mouse trap
not intended for bears, while the fox
stood below giggling. After he had
amused himself enough with Titehugge's
struggles, he scampered off to
find Stubtail; bawling out, 'Good-by,
my d-e-a-r friend, I hope you'll find
the honey answer your expectations.'</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, master Stubtail was
snoring away like a catamount, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the fox trotted up, and seating himself
beside him, began to sing a popular
fox ballad, beginning, 'Oh? don't I
love to cheat 'em!'</p>

<p>"This soon awoke Stubtail, and
opening his eyes, he saw the fox sitting,
singing away, as if he never
dreamed of such a person as Stubtail
being near.</p>

<p>"'Well, master fox!' he said, in a
dandified way, 'whawt business have
you, I should like to know, in the&mdash;aw
company of a bearah of fashion?
Make your mannahs, sir, and don't sit
down before your bettahs! How horrid
vulgah you are&mdash;aw!'</p>

<p>"Up jumped the fox, and made
such a beautiful bow this time, that
he fell over on his nose, and nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
stuck his tail in the bear's face, as he
exclaimed, 'Oh, my d-e-a-r friend!
d-o-n'-t say that! I didn't mean to be
uncivil. I only came to ask you to a
little fox party that is coming off this
afternoon, if your highness will favor
us with your honorable company.
Only ten of my cousins and seven of
my brothers and sisters are coming&mdash;just
a nice little family party; but
then they are all such beauties! particularly
my cousin, Miss Slygo Brighteyes!
She is perfectly lovely; as slender
as a bean pole, and smooth as a
young rabbit; and then such sharp
teeth, such a fine bushy tail! oh my!
and <i>such</i> a dancer, too, as she is!'</p>

<p>"Now, Stubtail was as fond of
dancing and flirting as his brother of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
eating, and tried to be a great dandy
and beau; so when master fox gave
such a glowing description of Miss
Slygo Brighteyes, his charming cousin,
Stubtail's whiskers curled up tighter
than ever; and he could hardly manage
to <i>drawl</i> out, 'Aw&mdash;yaas, I think I
<i>will</i> dwop in for harf an 'ouah!'</p>

<p>"When the fox heard that, he
was ready to stand on his head for
joy; and could scarcely wait while
Stubtail opened his carpet bag, and
took out his all-rounder collar, his
lemon-colored kid gloves, and his pork
pie hat, to wear at the fox's party.</p>

<p>"But what has become of Titehugge?'
he asked, suddenly noticing
that his brother was not there.</p>

<p>"'Oh, never mind <i>him</i>,' said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
fox, 'I saw the selfish little wretch
gobbling away at some honey as I
came along, and you see he was too
greedy to ask you to share it.'</p>

<p>"This was enough for Stubtail,
who was too hard at work drawing
on his tight gloves to think of anything
else, and away he trotted with
the fox; who took him to a lonely hollow
in the wood, where, sure enough,
there were about fifty other foxes
clustered together, but who looked at
Stubtail as he came among them, in
anything but a pleasant manner.</p>

<p>"'Now, my friends!' exclaimed
master fox himself, in a furious tone,
'you see before you the son of that
old scoundrel Grumpy-growly, who
nearly killed me last year. At him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
my dear cousins! scratch his eyes out!
ahaaa!' and with a long growl of rage
the fox made a sudden jump at poor
Stubtail before he had time to run
away, followed by all the others.</p>

<p>"Stubtail fought like a perfect Zouave,
hugging, scratching, and biting
his enemies with might and main; but
after all, one poor little cub could not
do very much against a whole army
of foxes, and Stubtail would have been
killed outright before long, when suddenly
a tremendous growling was
heard! and up dashed Grumpy-growly
himself, who most fortunately happened
to be passing, and came to see
what the row was, followed by Longclawse
and Bushyball, full tilt! They
didn't stop to inquire whether this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a free fight or not, but pitched in like
a thousand of bricks, and demolished
the foxes in a way which astonished
them considerable.</p>

<p>"As to master fox, he was making
off first of anybody, leaving his
friends in the lurch; but Grumpy-growly
saw him, and catching him by
the ear, made him confess all the mischief
he had been about that morning;
and as soon as he had finished, Grumpy-growly
gave him one good hug,
which killed him as dead as a coffin
nail.</p>

<p>"After the grand battle was over,
Grumpy-growly marshalled the three
cubs before him, hanging their heads,
and looking perfectly miserable with
shame and fatigue, and started off to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
find Titehugge; scolding and beating
them all the way for their naughty
conduct, though they were punished
enough already; for Longclawse and
Bushyball had gone to the election,
where they had been well pummelled
by a shoulder-hitting baboon, because
they insisted on voting for Douglas
as the beariest fellow on the ticket,
and afterward met by their father,
who gave them another thrashing for
daring to come out without leave, and
dragged them howling away. Stubtails
ears were torn into ribbons, his
head bleeding in twenty places, and
unfortunately no 'Balm of the Blooming
Blossoms of Gilead' to put on it,
and, in short, the whole party looked
as if they had been at an Irish funeral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and nearly been made 'cold corpuses'
themselves. After a long hunt,
they at last found Titehugge stuck fast
where the fox had left him, and now
the puzzle was to get him out. The
three brothers all tried in vain, and at
last Grumpy-growly caught hold of
Titehugge's tail, Longclawse of Grumpy-growly's,
Stubtail of Longclawse's,
and Bushyball of Stubtail's, and they
all pulled and tugged together; ouf!
ouf! altogether now! one, two, three,
Pop! out came Titehugge, and out
came his tail, too! and the five bears
rolled head over heels together in such
a hurley-burley, that it was a long
time before they could get straight
enough to start for home; and when
they <i>did</i> get there, Grumpy-growly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
put up the big log again, and put a
big stone on top of that, and a hundred
pound weight on top of that, and
<i>one</i> of those home-made pies we used
to have at boarding school on top of
<i>that</i>, which proved the heaviest of the
lot, and if they ever happened to get
out of prison again, it is more than I
know."</p>

<p>Thus ended the wonderful story
of the five bears, which gave great
amusement to the hearers, and was
pronounced "first rate." Pretty soon
after, they had a scrambling sort of
tea, not quite as orderly as dinner, for
they were all tired out with the day's
adventures; and about seven o'clock,
George, who, as I told you, was the
oldest of the party, sensibly proposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
that the regiment should go "early to
bed," on the principle of the old maxim,
and in order to be "early to rise,"
after the example of real soldiers.</p>

<p>As they were not quite certain
what were the usual ceremonies attendant
upon soldiers' retiring, Freddy
undertook to "do the thing up
brown," as he said, in a novel and delightfully
military manner. So, taking
his place about a dozen yards in advance
of the camp, and standing as
stiff as a ramrod, just as he had seen
the officers do at West Point, he called
out "Battalion, attention!"</p>

<p>At these words, the regiment
strung themselves in a long line, like
so many kibobs on a straw, with their
captains standing in front. "Now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Captain Livingston, dismiss your company
to quarters," and off marched
the first company, four "men" strong,
toward the tents; then the next four,
and so on, until all had gone, and then
came posting back again without the
smallest delay.</p>

<p>Colonel Freddy was obediently following
his own orders by dismissing
himself, with a sublime disregard of
rank, when Peter suddenly called out,
"I say, Fred, there's one thing you've
forgotten!"</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Freddy,
stopping short.</p>

<p>"Why, we ought to have a guard.
You know they always do in camps."</p>

<p>"To be sure! I never thought of
that. Come, fellows, the safety of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Camp McClellan must be looked out
for."</p>

<p>"Very well, suppose you begin!"
laughed Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Hum, I'm the Colonel; Colonels
can't be sentinels."</p>

<p>"But I want to go to bed!" objected
Will Costar.</p>

<p>"Well, I love my country, but I
think the country had better turn in
too!" said Harry. "What business
has the country to be awake and
getting into mischief in the middle of
the night?"</p>

<p>"Voted," cried Peter, "that the
guard be mounted, but that it shall go
to bed as soon as it gets sleepy!"</p>

<p>"Good for you! that's the way to
fix it!" said Colonel Freddy. "Now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
then, boys, who'll turn out?" and two
of the gallant Zouaves being posted,
one on each side of the camp, the
others produced their nightgowns
(which, by their special entreaty, had
been crammed into the little knapsacks),
and with several hair breadth
escapes from having one or two of the
tents pitched over, as the occupants
incautiously ran against the poles, the
regiment after, I am glad to say, a
most sincere and earnest repetition of
their prayers, fell into the sweet sound
sleep of happy childhood; while the
guard, after prancing up and down
about ten minutes, concluded to follow
their example, as there was nothing
particular in the way of an enemy to
look out for.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah! how charming looked now
the little encampment, with the full
radiance of the harvest moon streaming
over the white tents, standing
gleamingly out from the dark background
of trees. No sound but the
chirpings of insects could be heard;
nothing moved about the spot but the
flag, stirring dreamily in the summer
breeze. And now the wind springs
fresher up; it catches the bright folds,
and they flash out in full view. God
bless you, glorious old banner! floating
there over as loyal, though boyish
hearts, as ever beat in the midnight
camp of the Army of Freedom.</p>
